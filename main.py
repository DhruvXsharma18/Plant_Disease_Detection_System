        ### How It Works
        1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
        2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
        3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.
        
        ### Why Choose Us?
        - **Accuracy:** Advanced machine learning techniques for precise detection.
        - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface.
        - **Fast and Efficient:** Quick results for timely decisions.
        
        ### Get Started
        Use the sidebar to navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image to start.
